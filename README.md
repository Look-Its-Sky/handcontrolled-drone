<h1>Hand Controlled Drone Powered By MediaPipe Hands</h1>
<h3>a simple script to use your hand to fly a drone :)</h3>
<p>
move your hand left and right to turn the drone<br>
its kinda broken<br>
it only works with codrone edu drones<br>
and it always thinks your hand is moving backwards --- butttttt backwards is disabled<br>
the code is flawed but it was a cool project :) <br>
turning the drone left and right works though<br><br>

install dependencies with <code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code><br>
then run with <code>python3 main.py</code>
</p>
